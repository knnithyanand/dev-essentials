# Quick Setup

Setting up a development environment on Windows is really easy, thanks to [Boxstarter](http://boxstarter.org) and [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org).

## Running Scripts

To run a setup script, click a link in the table below from your target machine. This will download Boxstarter, and prompt you for Boxstarter to run with Administrator privileges (which it needs to do its job). Clicking yes in this dialog will cause the script to begin. You can then leave the job unattended and come back when it's finished.
