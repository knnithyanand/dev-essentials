## Developer Essentials

Every time I reinstall or get a new development system (PC or Mac), I end up installing same set of basic tools every time. Yet, everytime I have to search for installers and read through same set of articles for commands & instructions.

I decided to document these steps here so that these set of instructions is all in one place, I'd like to share this with others and get suggestions on for platforms, programming languages and tools that I may have missed off.
